nginx can act as a reverse proxy, load balencer, enryption ..

the content type header on nginx is by default text/plain
but if i wanna include a css file or js or png ... it will always condidered as text/plain

to solve this prob we will "include mime.types;" to inform the client (browser) how to to handle each file
